Main Instructions
1. There are two kinds of control setups here, both of which are just temporary
    a) With the blink detection of eyes, which are run by the src in 'bed' folder and 'blink2.py' python file
    b) With the GUI created using PyQt, which are run by the src in 'bedgui' folder and 'blink2_gui.py' python file
2. For both of the above methods, the current state of certain part of the bed is received by the user through the Serial Monitor of the ESP32 used. This method is temporary and is only used for debugging purposes.  
3. The Serial Output for both of the above mentioned controls are similar.
